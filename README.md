# Personal Training System

## Project Overview
A web application that helps personal trainers create customized workout programs for clients in minutes instead of hours. The system uses AI to handle repetitive aspects of program design while maintaining the trainer's professional judgment and expertise.

## Key Features for MVP (30-Day Target)

- **Client profile creation & management**
- **Program generation** based on client parameters
- **Program customization interface**
- **Exportable client-facing workout plans**
- **Basic progress tracking**

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (scalable, flexible schema)
- **AI Integration**: Claude API for program generation
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway or Render (backend)
- **Development**: Cursor IDE for accelerated coding

## Data Requirements

### Exercise Library
- Basic library of 100-200 exercises with descriptions
- Option to add custom exercises

### Program Templates
- Strength training
- Hypertrophy
- Weight loss
- Sport-specific conditioning

### Client Parameters
- Fitness level
- Available equipment
- Training frequency
- Goals
- Limitations/injuries

## Post-MVP Features (Future Development)

- Exercise demonstration videos
- Nutrition guidance integration
- Mobile app for clients
- Advanced analytics and progress visualization
- Online payment processing for trainers

## Marketing & Launch Strategy

- **Initial Users**: Recruit 5-10 trainers for beta testing
- **Feedback Loop**: Implement structured feedback system
- **Launch Channels**:
  - Fitness professional groups on Facebook/LinkedIn
  - Instagram with before/after examples of time saved
  - Direct outreach to local gyms and training facilities

## Key Technical Challenges

- **Designing Effective Claude Prompts**: Creating prompts that generate useful, scientifically sound programs
- **Exercise Progression Logic**: Implementing intelligent progression based on client feedback
- **User Experience**: Making complex program design intuitive for trainers

## Development Roadmap

1. Setup project infrastructure and repository
2. Implement user authentication and client profiles
3. Develop exercise library and program templates
4. Integrate AI program generation
5. Build program customization interface
6. Create exportable workout plans
7. Implement basic progress tracking
8. Testing and refinement
9. Beta launch with selected trainers
10. Iterate based on feedback

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the development environment will be added as the project progresses.

## Contributing

Guidelines for contributing to the project will be established once the initial development framework is in place.
